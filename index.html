							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p class="major" style="font-size: 20px;">I am Bibek Satyal, a graduate student studying data analytics at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. My expertise lies in complex data analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling, and process automation. I have a keen interest for machine learning and I am actively seeking opportunities to broaden my knowledge and gain valuable experience in this domain.<br>
								<br>
								With over five years of experience, my focus has primarily been on data analysis and process automation. In addition to my technical and analytical skills, I have also developed leadership, customer service, project management, and teamwork skills. I am actively seeking an opportunity to collaborate with a passionate team dealing with extensive datasets, where I can leverage my technical and analytical skills to gain insights and develop diverse machine learning models.</p>

						<h2>Python | Machine Learning Research (In - Progress)</h2>
						<p>We are utilizing machine learning algorithms to measure the optical depth to the cosmic microwave background in simulated images of the early universe. In this process, we are employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze the simulated images and compare the results with those obtained from a regular neural networks that relies on statistical measurements. Our expectation is that the results obtained from the CNN-based analysis of the images will demonstrate higher accuracy compared to the results obtained from statistical measurements.</p>

							<h2>Python | Soccer Project</h2>
							<p>A comparison of twelve players' performances in club and international games was conducted using Poisson distribution. Two datasets, containing information on each player's appearances and goals over a three-year period, were used for the analysis. The results indicated a similarity in player's performance between club and international games.</p>

							<h2>Python | Machine Learning Project</h2>
							<p>We conducted an extensive analysis using four different machine learning models to explore the potential differences in their performance. Our analysis took into account various factors, including the model's architecture, hyperparameter settings, regularization methods, and noise robustness, which could contribute to variations in their predictions. To assess the performance of these models, we employed K-fold cross-validation with both 5 and 10 folds. Throughout the analysis, we utilized popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy for data analysis, along with matplotlib for visualizations. The results revealed that the models exhibited varying scores across different fold settings, indicating a slight variations in their performance.</p>

							<h2>R | Data Visualization Group Project</h2>
							<p>The study aimed to investigate the relationship between smoking behavior and sleep quality, specifically analyzing sleep efficiency and sleep duration. Various visualizations such as boxplots, barplots, and histograms were employed to present the data. The results revealed a significant impact of smoking behavior on sleep efficiency, while no substantial effect was found on sleep duration.</p>

							<h2>R | Airbnb Group Project</h2>
							<p>The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the potential relationship between geographical distribution and Airbnb pricing in Las Vegas. Statistical techniques including correlation and regression were employed. The main objective was to determine if a correlation existed between Airbnb prices and the distance from two key locations: the Las Vegas Strip and Downtown. While the initial raw data showed a moderate negative correlation between price and distance, the analysis results indicated a weak correlation between the distance from these locations and the prices of Airbnb listings.</p>
